            If your solar panels are installed on your eastern roof, it makes sense to use the majority of your solar electricity
            in the morning. To ensure you make the most of your solar electricity, we recommend using appliances like the 
            dishwasher or washing machine as soon as you get up or turning them on just before you head out the door for the day.

            The sun is at its strongest when it sits north in the sky at midday, which means if you have panels installed on your
            northern roof, the best time to utilise your solar electricity is anywhere from mid-morning to the afternoon. A north
            installation is perfect for stay-at-home parents or those who work from home, or alternatively you can set timers on your
            large appliances like dishwashers and washing machines to start at midday while you are at work.

            <b>
            When the sun shines onto a solar panel, energy from the sunlight is absorbed by the PV cells in the panel.
            This energy creates electrical charges that move in response to an internal electrical field in the cell,
            causing electricity to flow.
